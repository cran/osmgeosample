<h2>An R Package for Geostatistical Sampling Designs with OSM data</h2>

<h3>Henry Crosby, Godwin Yeobah, J. Porto De Albuquerque</h3>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
We introduce a new <em>R</em> package, <em>OSMGeosample</em>, for constructing geostatistical sampling designs with OSM data. The new package implements random and spatially-regulated sampling designs. We illustrate the use of the package using a boundary dataset and OSM building data for a slum in Idikan. In addition, we provide the ability to sample on user-defined locations which can be joined to OSM features for reproducibility and the extension of information. The user can sample OSM features of one or more data type (point, line, polygon etc) and one or more value and key pairs.</p>

<p><em>OSMGeosample</em> can be downloaded from github at <a href="https://github.com/IGSD-UoW/osmgeosample">https://github.com/IGSD-UoW/osmgeosample</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We provide spatial sampling designs for investigating unobserved spatial phenomena, i.e., identifying properties to select for a survey. We create a randomized inhibitory spatial sampling functions to address the problem of spatial prediction (Chipeta et al, 2016). Two functions run inhibitory designs plus close pairs&#39; on discrete and continuous data. In an inhibitory design, any pair of sample locations must be separated by at least an inhibition distance ùõø. In addition, a third function runs random sampling for comparison.</p>

<p>The motivation for creating the methods in this package is undertake valid spatially-regulated sampling and to conduct a survey in irregular (urban) environments. In fact, in our example our sampling frame is the complete set of geo-located household locations in a slum in Idikan (Watson et al, 2019).</p>

<p>Unlike the <em>Geosample</em> package, the user is able to define a boundary to extract OSM features or use their own data to spatially join it to OSM features. In addition, the output table provides a list of the original and OSM ids with the (centroid) longitudinal and latitudinal values. Furthermore, the user is provided with an interactive map powered by the <em>mapview</em> package which shows the full dataset (in red) alongside the sampled dataset (in yellow) and the defined boundary or features.</p>

<h2>Installing OSM Geosample</h2>

<p>If you update the sf package and then try to install osmgeosample it will error ‚ÄúError: sf was built under R version ‚Ä¶‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt have the latest version of R, updating the version will fix this issue. Alternatively You can get around this by setting </p>

<h2>OSM Random Sampling (osm_random_sample)</h2>

<p>The osm_random_sample function creates a spatially random sample from either (1) a discrete set of OSM features defined in the function parameters or (2) a continuous surface defined by a user specified geographical region. The OSM features can be a subset of all features based on OSM key and value pairs (i.e., buildings, cafes, restaurants etc). The features can also be a subset of all data based on the feature type (i.e., point, polygon etc). An interactive map and data.frame are returned, both showing the full dataset, geographical locations and sampled data.</p>

<h3>Parameters:</h3>

<p><strong>bounding_geom:</strong> an <em>sf</em> or <em>sp</em> object (with N \geq
 size) where each line corresponds to one spatial location. It
 should contain values of 2D coordinates, data and, optionally, covariate(s)
 value(s) at the locations. This argument must be provided when sampling
 from a &#39;discrete&#39; set of points, see &#39;type&#39; below for
 details. This should only be provided when boundary_or_feature 
 = &#39;boundary&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>dis_or_cont:</strong> a string of either &#39;discrete&#39;,
 from a set of N potential sampling points or &#39;continuum&#39; from
 independent, &#39;completely&#39; random points.</p>

<p><strong>sample_size:</strong> a non-negative integer giving the total number of
 locations to be sampled.</p>

<p><strong>plotit:</strong> a &#39;logical&#39; specifying if graphical output is required. Default
 is plotit = TRUE.</p>

<p><strong>plotit_leaflet:</strong> a &#39;logical&#39; specifying if leaflet (html) graphical output
 is required. This is prioritised over plotit if both are selected. Default
 is plotit_leaflet = TRUE.</p>

<p><strong>boundary:</strong> a categorical variable to determine whether the exact boundary 
(boundary = 0), bounding box (boundary = 1) or a
 buffer around the boundary boundary = 2) is used for sampling.
 Default is boundary = 0.</p>

<p><strong>buff_dist:</strong> if boundary = 2 then this value determines the size
 of the buffer by distance. The default is buff_dist is NULL).</p>

<p><strong>buff_epsg:</strong> if boundary = 2 then this value determines the local
 geographic grid reference so that the buffer can be calculated in meters.
 The default is  buff_epsg = 4326) which will use decimal degrees
 instead of meters. As an example, 27700 relates to the British National
 Grid.</p>

<p><strong>join_type:</strong> a text value to determine how to spatially join all features
 with the boundary. The options are &#39;within&#39; or &#39;intersect&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>key:</strong> A feature key as defined in OSM. An example is &#39;building&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>value:</strong> a value for a feature key (&#39;key&#39;); can be negated with an
 initial exclamation mark, value = &#39;!this&#39;, and can also be a vector, value

 returned. More than one can be selected. The options are &#39;osm_polygons&#39;,
 &#39;osm_points&#39;, &#39;osm_multipolygons&#39;,&#39;osm_multilines&#39;,&#39;osm_lines&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>boundary_or_feature:</strong> specifies whether the user inputs a boundary or
 a set of user-inputted features. For example if the user selects &ldquo;boundary&rdquo;,
 they can provide a spatial data frame or OSM locality which will query the
 osm features within that boundary or locality. If the user selects &ldquo;feature&rdquo;
 then they can provide a data frame of features that they want to sample.</p>

<p><strong>feature_geom:</strong>  is a user inputted  data frame of features that are
 required to be sampled. This should only be provided when boundary_or_feature 
 = &#39;feature&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>join_features_to_osm:</strong> is a TRUE or FALSE variable which allows the
 user to specify whether they want their feature geom to be spatially joined
  to OSM features. The output sampling data frame will have an additional
  column showing the joined &#39;OSM_id&#39;. The interactive map will also plot the OSM
  features.</p>

 containing the final sampled ids (osm, original or both), centroid longitude and
 latitude and a 0/1 value determining whether the instance is in the selected
 sample (named inSample), if sampling from a &#39;discrete&#39; set of points. A data.frame object of dimension <em>n</em> by <em>3</em> containing the serial id and centroid 
 locations for all sample instances,if sampling from a &#39;continuum&#39;. </p>

<h3>Returns</h3>

<h3>Details (Chipeta, 2019)</h3>

<p>To draw a sample of size n from a population of spatial
  locations X_{i} : i  = 1,&hellip;,N, with the property that the
  distance between any two sampled locations is at least delta, the
  function implements the following algorithm. </p>

<p>Step 1. Draw an initial sample of size n completely at random and call this
    x_i  : i  = 1,&hellip;,n.</p>

<p>Step 2. Set i  = 1. </p>

<p>Step 3. Calculate the smallest distance, d_min, from x_i  to
  all other x_j  in the initial sample.</p>

<p>Step 4. If d_min &gt;= delta}, increase i by 1 and return to step 2 if
  {i &lt;= n}, otherwise stop. </p>

<p>Step 5. If d_min &lt; delta,
  draw an integer j  at random from 1,  2,..,N, set
  x_i  = X_j  and return to step 3.</p>

<p>Samples generated in this way exhibit  more regular spatial arrangements
  than random samples of the same size. The degree of regularity
  achievable will be influenced by the spatial arrangement of the population
  (X_i  : i  = 1,&hellip;,N), the specified value of delta and
  the sample size, n. For any given population, if n  and/or
  delta is too large, a sample of the required size with the distance
  between any two sampled locations at least delta will not be
  achievable; the algorithm will then find n_s &lt; n points that can be
  placed for the given parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Sampling close pairs of points.</strong></p>

<p>For some purposes, typically when using the same sample for parameter
  estimation and spatial prediction, it is desirable that a spatial sampling
  scheme include pairs of closely spaced points (x). The OSMGeosample offers
  two ways of specifying close pairs, either as the closest available
  unsampled point to an existing sampled point (cp.critetrion =
  cp.neighb), or as a random choice from all available unsampled
  points within distance zeta of an existing sampled point
  (cp.criterion = cp.zeta). The algorithm proceeds as follows.</p>

<p>Let k be the required number of close pairs. </p>

<p>Step 1. Construct a simple inhibitory design <strong>SI</strong>(n - k, \delta).</p>

<p>Step 2. Sample k from x<em>1,&hellip;, x</em>{n-k} without
  replacement and call this set x_j : j = 1,&hellip;, k}.</p>

<p>Step 3. For each x<em>j: j = 1,&hellip;, k}, select a close pair
  x</em>{n-k+j} according to the specified criterion.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>(1) Depending on the spatial configuration of potential sampling
  locations and, when the selection criterion (cp.criterion = cp.zeta),
  the specified value of zeta, it is possible that one or more of the
  selected points  x_j in Step 2 will not have an eligible &ldquo;close
  pair&#39;&#39;. In this case, the algorithm will try  find an alternative
  x_j and report a warning if it fails to do so.</p>

<p>(2) If &#39;delta&#39; is set to 0, a completely random sample is generated.
  In this case, &#39;close pairs&#39; are not permitted and &#39;zeta&#39;
  becomes trivial.</p>

<h2>OSM Inhibitory Sampling with Continuous Data (osm_contin_inhibit_sample)</h2>

<p>osm_contin_inhibit_sample creates a spatially continous sample of locations within a
  polygonal sampling using inhibitory plus close pairs&#39; (Chipeta, 2019). The region can be defined using OSM data or a user defined polygon or features. The OSM features can be a subset all features based on OSM key and value pairs (i.e., buildings, cafes, restaurants etc). The features can also be a of all data based on the feature type, i.e., point, polygon etc. An interactive map and data.frame are both returned, both showing the full dataset, geographical locations and sampled data.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><strong>bounding_geom:</strong> a {sf} or {sp} object (with {N \geq
  {size}}) where each line corresponds to one spatial location. It
  should contain values of 2D coordinates, data and, optionally, covariate(s)
  value(s) at the locations. This argument must be provided when sampling
  from a {&#39;discrete&#39;} set of points, see {&#39;type&#39;} below for
  details.</p>

<p><strong>sample_size:</strong> a non-negative integer giving the total number of
 locations to be sampled.</p>

<p><strong>plotit:</strong> a &#39;logical&#39; specifying if graphical output is required. Default
 is plotit = TRUE.</p>

<p><strong>plotit_leaflet:</strong> a &#39;logical&#39; specifying if leaflet (html) graphical output
 is required. This is prioritised over plotit if both are selected. Default
 is plotit_leaflet = TRUE.</p>

<p><strong>boundary:</strong> a categorical variable to determine whether the exact boundary 
(boundary = 0), bounding box (boundary = 1) or a
 buffer around the boundary boundary = 2) is used for sampling.
 Default is boundary = 0.</p>

<p><strong>buff_dist:</strong> if boundary = 2 then this value determines the size
 of the buffer by distance. The default is buff_dist is NULL).</p>

<p><strong>buff_epsg:</strong> if boundary = 2 then this value determines the local
 geographic grid reference so that the buffer can be calculated in meters.
 The default is  buff_epsg = 4326) which will use decimal degrees
 instead of meters. As an example, 27700 relates to the British National
 Grid.</p>

<p><strong>join_type:</strong> a text value to determine how to spatially join all features
 with the boundary. The options are &#39;within&#39; or &#39;intersect&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>key:</strong> A feature key as defined in OSM. An example is &#39;building&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>value:</strong> a value for a feature key (&#39;key&#39;); can be negated with an
 initial exclamation mark, value = &#39;!this&#39;, and can also be a vector, value
 = c (&#39;this&#39;, &#39;that&#39;). An example is &#39;cafe&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>data_return:</strong> specifies what data types (as specified in OSM) you want
 returned. More than one can be selected. The options are &#39;osm_polygons&#39;,
 &#39;osm_points&#39;, &#39;osm_multipolygons&#39;,&#39;osm_multilines&#39;,&#39;osm_lines&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>boundary_or_feature:</strong> specifies whether the user inputs a boundary or
 a set of user-inputted features. For example if the user selects &quot;boundary&rdquo;,
 they can provide a spatial data frame or OSM locality which will query the
 osm features within that boundary or locality. If the user selects &ldquo;feature&rdquo;
 then they can provide a data frame of features that they want to sample.</p>

<p><strong>feature_geom:</strong>  is a user inputted  data frame of features that are
 required to be sampled. This should only be provided when boundary_or_feature 
 = &#39;feature&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>join_features_to_osm:</strong> is a TRUE or FALSE variable which allows the
 user to specify whether they want their feature geom to be spatially joined
  to OSM features. The output sampling data frame will have an additional
  column showing the joined &#39;OSM_id&#39;. The interactive map will also plot the OSM
  features.</p>

<p><strong>delta:</strong> minimum permissible distance between any two locations in
  preliminary sample. This can be allowed to vary with the number of
 {&#39;close pairs&#39;} if a \bold{simple inhibitory} design is compared to
  one of the \bold{inhibitory plus close pairs} design.</p>

<p><strong>delta.fix:</strong> &#39;logical&#39; specifies whether {delta} is fixed or allowed
to vary with number of close pairs {k}. Default is {delta.fix =
  FALSE}.</p>

<p><strong>k:</strong> number of locations in preliminary sample to be replaced by near
  neighbours of other preliminary sample locations to form {close pairs}
  (integer between 0 and {size/2}). A \bold{simple inhibitory} deisgn is
  generated when {k = 0}.</p>

<p><strong>rho:</strong> maximum distance between the two locations in a
 {&#39;close-pair&#39;}.</p>

<p><strong>ntries:</strong> number of rejected proposals after which the algorithm will terminate.</p>

<h3>Details (Chipeta, 2019)</h3>

<p>To draw a simple inhibitory (<strong>SI</strong>) sample of size n
  from a spatially continuous region (A), with the property that the
  distance between any two sampled locations is at least delta, the
  following algorithm is used. </p>

<p>Step 1. Set i  = 1 and
  generate a point x_1  uniformly distributed on D.</p>

<p>Step 2. Generate a point x  uniformly distributed on
  D and calculate the minimum, d_min, of the distances
  from x_i to all x_j: j &lt;= i. </p>

<p>Step 3. If d_min &gt;= delta, increase i  by 1, set x_i = x and
  return to step 2 if i &lt;= n}, otherwise stop;</p>

<p>Step 4. If
  d_min &lt; delta, return to step 2 without increasing i. </p>

<p>\bold{Sampling close pairs of points.}</p>

<p>For some purposes, it is desirable that a spatial sampling scheme include
  pairs of closely spaced points, resulting in an inhibitory plus close pairs
  (<strong>ICP</strong>) design. In this case, the above algorithm requires the
  following additional steps to be taken. Let k  be the required number
  of close pairs. Choose a value rho  such that a close pair  of
  points will be a pair of points separated by a distance of at most
  {rho}. </p>

<p>Step 5. Set j  = 1 and draw a random sample of size 2 from integers 1, 2,&hellip;, n, say (i_1, i_2);</p>

<p>Step 6. Replace x_i_1 by x_i_2 + u, where
  u  is uniformly distributed on the disc with centre x_i_2
  and radius (rho), increase i by 1 and return to step 5 if i
  &lt;= k, otherwise stop.</p>

<p>When comparing a <strong>SI</strong> design to one of the <strong>ICP</strong> designs, the
  inhibitory components should have the same degree of spatial regularity.
  This requires delta to become a function of k namely
  delta_k = delta_0*(sqrt{n/(n - k)}) with delta_0 held.</p>

<h3>Returns</h3>

<p>(1) A data.frame object named &#39;results&#39; of length <em>n</em>
 containing the final sampled osmgeosample_ids, centroid longitude and
 latitude. </p>

<p>(2) An interactive map powered by <strong>mapview</strong> showing the boundary, full dataset and
sampled data.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>If &#39;delta&#39; is set to 0, a completely random sample is generated.
  In this case, &#39;close pairs&#39; are not permitted and rho is
  irrelevant.</p>
